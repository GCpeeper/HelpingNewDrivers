      <h2>How to Pump Gas</h2>
      <p>Knowing how to pump gas is an important skill to have once you own a car. Though it is not relevant for electric cars, it is still helpful to know how to.</p>
      <p>It can seem pretty daunting if you are new, but it is relatively straight forward once you understand how it works. The first step is pulling up to the gas station with the gas pump facing the same side as the fuel lid on the side of your car. Once you have parked you may need to lock the fuel lid from the inside of your car - check your owner's manual or test out opening the fuel lid before to figure out if it needs to be unlocked. Once you have left your car turned off and locked, take your payment method with you and open the fuel lid to check the type of gas your car needs. It will say the type on the inside of the lid. Then either go inside to pay or pay on the stand and select the fuel type you need, pay, unscrew the cap to your gas tank, and insert the nozzle. There is also a button on the handle that can be used to hold it in place, some smaller cars may not work with this though and you may still need to hold it to keep the gas is pumping. Once the pump unlocks then you are done and can take out the nozzle and put it back in place, rescrew your gas cap, close the fuel lid, and finally leave. Nice!</p>
