      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Etiquette</h1>
      <p>There are many rules for driving, written and unwritten. Most, if not all of these rules are not only polite but also make the road safer.</p>
      <h2>General</h2>
      <div class="standard-grid">
      <div class="a1">
        <h3>Following Distance</h3>
        <p>It is important to keep a reasonable distance from the car in front of you. Not only is tailgating rude to the driver in front, it's also dangerous. It leaves too little time to react if the flow of traffic changes abruptly.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="c2">
        <h3>High Beams</h3>
        <p>High beams can be very useful at night, especially in areas with no street lights, to help you see further. It's prohibited to use high beams when driving near oncoming traffic, as it could blind a driver. Although it may be some people's first instinct, it's also not recommended to use brights in foggy weather because it can reflect off the water droplets in the air, reducing visibility. Instead, dimmer or fog lights should be used.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="a2">
        <h3>Pedestrian Awareness</h3>
        <p>If a pedestrian is waiting near a sidewalk, the driver should yield and allow them to cross safely. If a pedestrian is walking on the side of the road, even if it's not entirely legal, drivers should give space if possible. Divers have a responsibility to avoid inflicting harm upon a pedestrian, if reasonable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="c1">
        <h3>Use of Horn</h3>
        <p>Several states have laws against using a car horn in certain situations, so it should only be used in emergencies to alert other drivers or pedestrians.</p>
      </div>
     </div>
      <h2>Highway etiquette</h2>
      <p>Highways require drivers to ride at very high speeds, increasing danger and thus the amount of caution exercised.
        Higher speeds means that the distance between two cars should be longer. The addition of more lanes than regular roads also complicates your interactions with other drivers on the road.
      </p>

      <p>As explained in the video above, it's important to pay attention to your speed and what lane you're in. Try to limit the use of the left lane just to passing, and don't drive slowly in that lane. In addition to this, always use your turn signal, and make sure you have plenty of space to merge into a lane, as cutting someone off could be dangerous and cause traffic. One last note is to be aware that many states prohibit semi trucks from driving in the leftmost lane, and they typically take much longer to slow down, so it's especially important to give them extra room.</p>
