            Driver's Ed is a formal program designed to teach new drivers the fundamentals of safe driving. 
            It covers everything from basic traffic laws to defensive driving techniques, 
            helping you gain the skills and knowledge you need to drive safely and responsibly. <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <span style="font-size: 20px;">Why It's Important</span> <br> <br>
            Many states require teens to complete a driver&apos;s education course before taking their road test. 
            Even if it&apos;s not mandatory in your area, 
            Driver&apos;s Ed can be a great way to boost your confidence and ensure you're prepared for the road. 
            It also helps to lower insurance rates and builds the foundation for lifelong safe driving habits.

            <span style="font-size: 20px;">What to Expect</span> <br> <br>
            Most programs combine classroom instruction with behind-the-wheel training. 
            In the classroom, you&apos;ll learn about road signs, traffic laws, and safe driving practices. 
            The behind-the-wheel portion allows you to apply what you&apos;ve learned, 
            practicing everything from parking to highway driving under the guidance of an instructor. <br> <br>

            Driver's Ed courses are offered by various organizations, including high schools, driving schools, and online platforms. 
            Be sure to choose a program that is approved by your state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or transportation department. <br> <br> <br> <br>

          <h2>Knowledge Test</h2>
          <p>
            The knowledge test is a written or computerized exam designed to assess your understanding of 
            essential driving rules and regulations.
            The test format varies by state, but it usually has around 20-50 multiple choice questions, 
            and you must answer a certain percentage correctly to pass.
            Passing this test is a prerequisite to taking the driving test. <br> <br>

          <h2>Driving Test</h2>
          <p>
            The driving test assesses your practical driving skills to ensure you can operate a vehicle safely 
            and follow the rules of the road.
            You'll be asked to demonstrate basic driving maneuvers such as turning, stopping, 
            backing up, parallel parking, and driving in traffic.
            The instructor will evaluate your ability to control the vehicle, 
            make safe decisions, and obey traffic laws. <br> <br>

          <h2>Licensing</h2>
          <p>
            To get a driver's license after passing both the knowledge and driving tests, 
            you need to schedule an appointment at your local Department of Licensing (DOL) office, 
            bring required identification documents, pay the necessary fees, 
            and complete the application process in person; 
            you will typically receive a temporary license at the office and 
            your permanent card will be mailed to you later. <br> <br>
