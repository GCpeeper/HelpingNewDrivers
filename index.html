                <div class="l-shape-boarder-top">
                  <p>Driving offers numerous advantages that make it a popular choice
                    for many. One of the main reasons people drive is convenience—it
                    allows for personal control over schedules, making it easier to
                    run errands, travel directly to a destination, or carry heavy
                    items without relying on public transport. Driving also provides
                    a sense of freedom and flexibility, enabling spontaneous trips
                    or changes in plans without being restricted by bus or train
                    schedules. For many, it’s a time-efficient option, often quicker
                    than public transport, especially on routes with limited transit
                    availability.

                <p>
                  Comfort is another key benefit, as driving offers more privacy
                  and control over the environment. Whether it's adjusting the
                  temperature or enjoying personal music, driving can make long
                  journeys more enjoyable. Safety concerns, particularly at night
                  or in less accessible areas, also lead many to prefer driving
                  over public transportation. When traveling with family or friends,
                  driving becomes even more convenient, offering the ability to
                  share costs, communicate freely, and travel together seamlessly.

                  For those venturing into remote or rural areas, driving is often
                essential due to limited or no public transportation options.
                Additionally, cars and other vehicles are crucial for transporting
                goods, whether it’s groceries, furniture, or work-related equipment.
                Many jobs, such as delivery services and sales roles, rely on driving
                as a core part of daily operations. Finally, some simply enjoy the
                experience of driving, finding it a relaxing or exciting way to explore
                new places or unwind on the open road.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Driving offers convenience, freedom, and comfort, making
                  it an essential part of daily life for millions.

            <div class="when-drive-text">
            <p>
              Depending on where you live, the legal age to start learning to drive is
              different. However, in most places, you can start learning to drive at 15
              or 16 years old. In the United States, the legal age to start learning to
              depends on the state you live in. If you want to know your state's legal
              age look at the table below. It is important to start learning to drive
              early, this will allow you to get you liscense as soon as possible. It
              will also give you more experience on the road, which will make you a
              safer driver.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the United States, you need to take driver's education classes to get
              your liscense before you turn 18. These classes are still helpful even if
              you are over 18. They will help you learn the rules of the road and how to
              drive safely. You will need to take a written test and a driving test
              to get your liscense anyway.
